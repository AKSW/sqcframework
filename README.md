### SQCFramework: The SPARQL Queries Containment Benchmark Generation Framework 
SQCFramework is SPARQL query containment benchmark generation framework which is able to generate customized SPARQL containment benchmarks from real SPARQL query logs. The framework is flexible enough to generate benchmarks of varying sizes and according to the user-defined criteria on the most important SPARQL features to be considered for query containment benchmarking. The generation of benchmarks is achieved by selecting prototypical queries (of a user-defined size and specialized selection criteria) using different clustering algorithms.
